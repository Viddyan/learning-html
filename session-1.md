### **Lecture Notes: A Whirlwind Tour of the Web**  

#### **Rationale:**  
Understanding the foundational roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is critical to web development. This session introduces learners to the basic building blocks of the web and essential tools for hands-on practice. It sets the stage for mastering front-end development and navigating the developer ecosystem.  

#### **Objective:**  
By the end of this session, learners will:  
- Understand the distinct roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development.  
- Successfully set up and use essential development tools like code editors and browsers.  
- Create and edit basic HTML elements using a text editor and inspect them in a browser.  
- Navigate documentation effectively, particularly the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).

#### **4. Hands-On Coding: Our First Element - The Paragraph (10 minutes)**  
- **Practical Exercise:**  
   - Create a new HTML file.  
   - Write and save a `<p>` (paragraph) element:  
     ```html
     <p>Welcome to the whirlwind tour of the web!</p>
     ```  
   - Open the file in Chrome to view the output.  

#### **5. The Chrome Inspector (15 minutes)**  
- **Demonstration:**  
   - Show how to inspect and modify elements in Chrome's Developer Tools:  
     - Right-click > Inspect.

     <h2>Learning HTML</h2>
     ```  
   - Preview and compare their appearance.  

#### **7. Creating HTML Comments (5 minutes)**  
- **Hands-On Practice:**  
   - Explain the purpose of comments in code.  
   - Add a comment to the HTML file:  
     ```html
